				<p>Squads are player associations of up to 50 members, that allow players to gather at hubs to coordinate hunts with their friends.
					Players can also set specific messages among squads to identify each other. The Squad's icon and name is also displayed on all Squad Member Guild Cards.
					Each player can join up to 8 different squads, so you can coordinate with many friends and different groups based on your objectives</p>
